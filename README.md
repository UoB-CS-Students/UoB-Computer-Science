Introduction
------------
This GitHub account has a collection of repositories used for shared revision resources. Users can upload and edit notes, cheatsheets, links, etc. to help others. There is a different repository for each module. If you don't want to use git, you can still contribute - see [here][tutorial-link].

The Idea
--------
Sharing notes, solutions, and other resources is usually done by posting on social media groups, using Google Docs, or other cumbersome ways. 

My idea is to have a central location for the resources for a particular module. This way, the resources are kept organised and they can continue growing.

Expanding on this idea, I thought it would be useful to have a set of resources that can be edited by anyone. This way, typos, missing information, new information, etc., can be corrected by anyone, and then the administrator can publish these changes to all other users.

Modules
-------
- Year 2
	- [Professional Computing](https://github.com/UoB-CS-Students/Year-2-Prof-Comp)

Contributing
------------
If you wish to contribute to a particular module, follow the steps outlined [here][tutorial-link]. 

The main format used should be LaTeX, or plain text. If you wish to submit a a non-text file, please email [UoBCSGithub@googlemail.com][contact]. (Please try not to submit word documents).
	
###What if it isn't working?
If you have read through the [tutorial][tutorial-link], but it isn't making sense, you can post your changes/resources on the Facebook group, or you can email [UoBCSGithub@googlemail.com][contact] and an owner of the repository will try to include them.

Collaborating
-------------
If you want to start a repository for a module that is not currently available, please email [UoBCSGithub@googlemail.com][contact]. You will be responsible for reviewing the changes being made to the files in the repository. You do not need to be familiar with git to take on this role.
